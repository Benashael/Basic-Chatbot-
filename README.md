# Basic Chatbot
It deals with the Python code which executes basic chatbot.

# Package Used
The "random" library is used here to create the chatbot.

The "random" library in Python is a useful tool when creating a chatbot, as it allows you to introduce randomness and variability in the bot's responses, making it feel more human-like and natural. Here are some ways you can use the random library in your chatbot:
  1) Randomizing responses: Instead of always returning the same response to a given question, you can use the random library to select a response from a set of predefined options.
  2) Introducing variability: You can also use the random library to introduce variability in the way your chatbot responds.
  3) Randomizing delay: Finally, you can use the random library to add a random delay between the bot's responses to make it feel more human-like. 

# Execution
Execution of this project can be done in jupyter notebook or colab. If you want to execute the following code in Python IDLE, then you need to install "random" package.
